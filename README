# sudo make install-deps
# make install-toolchain

** TARGETs

*** arm-none-eabi
cortex-m0 cortex-m0+ cortex-m1 cortex-m3 cortex-m4 cortex-r cortex-a

*** powerpc-none-elf

*** m68k-none-elf
coldfire only

** MinGW setups
MS Windows MinGW toolchain must be built under linux.
To cross build a toolchain for mingw from ubuntu 12.10
cd install
make TARGETS="arm-none-eabi powerpc-none-elf m68k-none-elf"

After a very long time get installers in install/builds/i686-pc-mingw32
