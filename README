    gcc-4.8.0-arm-cortex-elf-multilibs.patch
    gcc-4.8.0-fix-gnatools-canadian.patch
    gcc-4.8.0-xgnatugn-canadian.patch

** GNAT

GNAT files are covered by GNAT Modified General Public License

GNAT files are not distributed with this project but copied from GCC installation when the RTS is build.

Only system.ads is modified and included in this project as it must be
implemented for each board (see also AdaRuntime).

* TOOLCHAIN and TOOLS

** Installation
Tested on xubuntu 12.10 i686 and x86_64 :
run
# sudo make install-deps
# make install-toolchain

** TARGETs

*** arm-none-eabi
cortex-m cortex-r cortex-a

*** powerpc-none-elf

*** m68k-none-elf
coldfire only

** MinGW setups
MS Windows MinGW toolchain must be built under linux.
To cross build a toolchain for mingw from ubuntu 12.10
cd install
make TARGETS="arm-none-eabi powerpc-none-elf m68k-none-elf"

After a very long time get installers in install/builds/i686-pc-mingw32

** TODO
Add avr target support
